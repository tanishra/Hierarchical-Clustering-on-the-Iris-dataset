# Hierarchical Clustering on the Iris Dataset 🌸

This project demonstrates how to perform **hierarchical clustering** on the classic **Iris dataset** using Python and visualization tools. It explores the structure of the data through unsupervised learning and reveals natural groupings among different species of Iris flowers.

## 📊 What is Hierarchical Clustering?

Hierarchical clustering is an unsupervised learning technique that builds nested clusters by either merging or splitting them successively. It’s often visualized using a **dendrogram** that shows the hierarchy of clusters.

There are two types:
- **Agglomerative** (bottom-up): Starts with each data point as its own cluster and merges them iteratively.
- **Divisive** (top-down): Starts with one large cluster and splits it recursively.

In this project, we use **Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering**.
